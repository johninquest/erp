<p align="center">A simple backend service built with Express.Js</p>

## Feature roadmap

Several features are considered **must-haves** for a well-rounded backend application, regardless of its specific purpose. Here are some key ones:

**1. Data Management:**

- **Databases:** A robust and secure database is crucial for storing, managing, and manipulating data efficiently. This could involve relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, NoSQL databases like MongoDB, or specialized solutions depending on the data type and application needs.
- **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):** APIs provide a structured way for other applications (including the frontend) to interact with the backend, allowing them to access and modify data.

**2. User Authentication and Authorization:**

- **User accounts:** Secure user accounts with proper authentication (login) and authorization (access control) mechanisms are essential for restricting access to sensitive data and functionalities. This might involve features like password hashing, session management, and role-based access control.

**3. Server-side Logic and Business Rules:**

- **Business logic processing:** The backend handles the core logic of the application, implementing necessary functionalities and business rules that govern data manipulation and user interactions.
- **Background tasks:** The backend can handle tasks that don't require immediate user interaction, such as sending emails, processing data backups, or scheduling jobs.

**4. Security:**

- **Data encryption:** Sensitive data should be encrypted both at rest (in storage) and in transit (during transmission) to protect it from unauthorized access.
- **Input validation and sanitization:** User inputs need to be validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
- **Regular security updates:** Keeping the backend software and dependencies updated with the latest security patches is crucial to address potential security flaws.

**5. Scalability and Performance:**

- **Scalability:** The backend should be designed to accommodate a growing user base and data volume without compromising performance. This might involve using a scalable architecture (e.g., horizontal scaling) and implementing caching mechanisms.
- **Performance optimization:** The backend should be optimized for performance by addressing bottlenecks, using efficient algorithms, and monitoring resource utilization.

**6. Monitoring and Logging:**

- **Logging:** Implementing comprehensive logging allows you to track application activity, identify errors, and troubleshoot issues effectively.
- **Monitoring:** Monitoring key metrics like server performance, resource usage, and user activity helps maintain application health and identify potential problems proactively.

These are just some of the essential features for a backend application. The specific requirements may vary depending on the application's purpose, complexity, and target audience.
